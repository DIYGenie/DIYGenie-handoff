A) Webhooks (API):
1) Create endpoint: GET /api/projects/:projectId/scans/latest
   - Auth: require user_id (query).
   - Behavior: return the MOST RECENT room_scans row for that project owned by user.
   - Response 200:
     { ok: true, scan: { id, image_url, roi, measure_status, measure_result } }
   - 404 if none found (return { ok:false, error:"scan_not_found" }).
   - Use existing ownership checks used in other endpoints.

2) Ensure CORS/JSON consistent with existing API style.
3) Add to API_MAP.md and log with `[scans latest]`.

B) App (ProjectDetails screen):
1) Data fetch:
   - On ProjectDetails mount (projectId available), call:
     GET /api/projects/:projectId/scans/latest?user_id=<currentUserId>
   - Store result in local state: latestScan.
   - If latestScan.measure_result exists, compute widthIn = round(measure_result.width_in), heightIn = round(measure_result.height_in).
   - Fallback image source priority:
     heroImage = project.preview?.url ?? latestScan?.image_url ?? null

2) Hero overlay:
   - If heroImage exists, render as current hero image.
   - Overlay in the bottom-right a rounded pill (semi-transparent blur or 90% opacity) showing:
     `W {widthIn}" × H {heightIn}"`
     - If missing measurement_result, instead show a subtle “Add measurements” pill; tapping navigates back to New Project > Scan flow (or opens the scan sheet if available).
   - Make the pill accessible: testID="hero-dimensions-pill".

3) Measurements card:
   - Insert a compact card near the top of the sections list (right after the “Open Detailed Build Plan” CTA).
   - Title: “Measurements”
   - Subtitle states:
     - If available: `~ {widthIn}" wide × {heightIn}" tall`
     - Else: “No measurements yet”
   - If measurements exist, also show small meta rows (monospace, muted):
     - “Scale: {px_per_in} px/in”
     - “From scan: #{shortScanId}”
   - If none, show a button “Measure from scan” that sends the user to the Scan sheet (reuse existing navigation you use for “Scan room”).

4) States & skeletons:
   - While fetching latest scan: show a skeleton shimmer bar in place of the pill and card (no layout shift).
   - If API 404: render “No scans yet”.

5) Styling details:
   - Use the app’s purple for the pill border with white text; slightly raised shadow for depth.
   - Keep the card consistent with other cards (rounded-xl, soft shadow).
   - Do NOT change other layout; this is additive.

C) Unit/QA hooks:
- Console markers:
  - `[details] dimensions fetch start`
  - `[details] dimensions ok { widthIn, heightIn }`
  - `[details] dimensions none`
- Add testIDs:
  - Measurements card container: testID="card-measurements"
  - “Measure from scan” button: testID="btn-measure-from-scan"

D) Edge cases:
- If measure_status !== 'done', show “Measuring…” and poll GET /api/projects/:id/scans/:scanId/measure/status every 2s (max 30s). Update the hero pill & card when done.
- If preview exists but measurement doesn’t, still show the pill in “Add measurements” state.

Deliverables:
- Updated webhooks endpoint + docs.
- Updated ProjectDetails with overlay pill + card.
- Resilient loading/empty/error states.
- No breaking changes to existing flows.

Please run the app (iOS) and verify:
- With a project that HAS a measured scan: pill shows `W 48" × H 30"` (using the stub or live result), and the Measurements card shows the same plus px/in.
- With a project that has a scan but no measurement: pill shows “Add measurements”; tapping goes to Scan.
- With no scan: pill hidden, card says “No measurements yet”.

Log the outcomes in the console with the markers above.
